- 👋 Hi, I’m @camjohn47.
- 👀 I’m interested in projects with deep learning, NLP, self-supervised learning, neuro-symbolic AI, program synthesis, knowledge graphs, multi-modal learning, unsupervised learning, sequence modeling, RL, and tons of others. 
- 🌱 Currently learning about neuro-symbolic AI, unsupervised entity linking, Kubernetes, data2vec applications, and deep learning ideas for bioinformatics problems like [DeepMind's AlphaFold for protein structure modeling](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03819-2.pdf). 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects where I can make valuable and creative contributions. 
- 📫 How to reach me: Please leave a comment, post an issue, or message me on LinkedIn. Will be happy to share email if you don't sound spammy!
